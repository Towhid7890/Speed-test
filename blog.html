        <h2>1. Write Difference between localStorage and Session Storage?</h2>
        <p>Ans: The difference between sessionStorage and localStorage is that localStorage data does not expire, where
            sessionStorage data is cleared when the page session ends. A unique page session gets created once a
            document is loaded in a browser tab. Page sessions are valid for only one tab at a time</p>

        <h2>2. Write difference between global scope and block scope?</h2>
        <p>Ans: The scope of a variable is the region of any program in which it is defined. JavaScript variables have
            only two scopes.Global Variables − A global variable has a global scope which means it can be defined
            anywhere in your JavaScript code. Local Variables − A local variable will be visible only within a function
            where it is defined. Function parameters are always local to that function. Within the body of a function, a
            local variable takes precedence over a global variable with the same name. If you declare a local variable
            or function parameter with the same name as a global variable, you effectively hide the global variable.</p>

        <h2>3. How Can we Find Undefined Value???</h2>
        <p>Ans: -if we do not declare the variable but not assign the value.
            -We create a function but did not call the function.
            -We declare the function parameter but not set the parameter value.
            -We declare an object and find the property..which property is not present in the object.
            -if array has no index
            -if we delete an array value..we cant use direct delete..if we do this output wil be undefined.
            -if we directly set the value undefined .the output will be undefined.</p>

        <h2>4.How javascript event loop works?</h2>
        <p>Ans:This is also called queue and stack way of javascript. The Event Loop has one simple — to monitor the
            Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack
            is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which
            effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.
